# What routes to make?

where are things shown on twitter?
see [different types of tweets](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/types-of-tweets).

###### tweets

- [x] profile page of sender
- [x] home of sender
- [x] home of followers

###### replies

- [x] profile of sender
- [ ] notifications of recipient
- [x] recipients home if the recipient is following the sender
- [x] home of anyone following both recipient and sender

###### mentions

- [ ] same as replies
- [ ] but without a parent tweet

###### rewtweet

- [x] same as tweets
- [ ] but also notifications of original tweet author

###### quote tweet

- [ ] same as retweet but with text

###### likes

- [ ] notifications of tweet author
- [ ] home of followers (maybe)

so basically invert this list from item -> places to place -> items
